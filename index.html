        <h2>What is this?</h2>

        <p>This page shows a random card from the "Occupations for Women" trading card series printed in the 19th century. These trading cards depict various "jobs" women could do. Images and data were scraped from the <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/collection" target="_blank">Met's</a> Collections page. If you like this project, consider visiting the Museum in NYC!</p>

        <p class="">So, I was reading this <a href="https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/the-greatest-sports-card-collection-ever-is-finally-where-everyone-can-see-it" target="_blank">article</a> about how the Metropolitan Museum of Art (in New York City) has the largest collection of vintage baseball cards. There was a link to a card of a trading card series called "Occupations for Women". I was curious and browsed the Met's records and quickly realized that the trading cards were a kind of old-timey soft core <em>erotica</em>. All the women depicted are scantily clad (for the 19th century), bosomy, and have hour-glass figures. The series, while serving as entertainment for men, also pokes cheeky fun at women by depicting them in traditionally masculine jobs; jobs they'll never really have (at least back then). In some cards, it depicts women in a kind of <em>reverse-drag</em> (pirate, King of Amazons).</p>
